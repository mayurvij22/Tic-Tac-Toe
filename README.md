Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete, alternating turns to place Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row, column, or diagonal wins!

Features:
Interactive Game Board: Players take turns marking the grid with Xs or Os.
Win Detection: Automatically detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
Responsive Design: The game is designed to be fully responsive, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
Simple UI: Clean and minimal user interface.
How to Play:
Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their marker (X or O).
The game checks for a winner after each turn.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure of the game board.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For game logic, including turn management, win/draw detection, and resetting the board.
